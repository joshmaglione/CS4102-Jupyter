Thanks to [Götz Pfeiffer](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/our-research/people/mathematical-statistical-sciences/goetzpfeiffer/) for making his [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/gpfeiffer/cs4102) available.

## What is this about? 

Half of our lectures in CS4102 will be putting into practice the data analysis methods we discuss. By using Jupyter Notebooks, we can look at text (including mathematics) as well as run Python code in the same document. 

## Do I need to be a Python expert? 

No. Ideally one is familiar with the general syntax and structure of Python code. If not, try playing around with `python_tutorial.ipynb`. This is a mini python tutorial written by [Götz Pfeiffer](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/our-research/people/mathematical-statistical-sciences/goetzpfeiffer/). 

## How can I get my Jupyter Notebooks to look like they do in class?

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) together with many extensions within VS Code for Jupyter Notebooks and Python.

For Python, the extensions I use are 
- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
  
For Jupyter Notebooks, the extensions I use are 
- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
- [Jupyter Notebook Renderers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers)

I also use [Rainbox CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) for viewing CSV files.
